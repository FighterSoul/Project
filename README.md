# Project Title
This project is a second-year Bachelor's degree project, developed using Angular and PHP.

## Tasks to be Completed

1. Refactor code: Replace hard-coded elements and objects with variables for backend implementation.
2. Improve UI responsiveness: The side navigation and sidebar should be responsive. Consider collapsing menus into icons for mobile view.
3. Enhance chat functionality: Modify the chatbox. Currently, the chat is hidden and only appears when an online friend is clicked. Implement a chatting function, add emoji support, and a feature to close the chatbox.
4. Implement group creation: Add a function to create a group. This should display a hidden form when the button is clicked. The form will be used to create a study room or group.
5. Add study group content: This can be considered for future development.
6. Complete routing: Ensure all components are properly routed for a Single Page Application (SPA) experience.
